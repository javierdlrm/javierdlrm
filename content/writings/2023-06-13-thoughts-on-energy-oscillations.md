18th June. After long time hearing and reading about the benefits of getting up early in the morning, I’m now starting to believe it was not all empty words in an intended motivational speech. Getting up at 05:45AM to go to the gym before starting my work shift has a lot of advantages compared with waking up right before commuting and postponing exercise for the late afternoon.

The action of getting up itself is generally irritable unless I have had a damn good quality sleep. So it is a matter of discipline and commitment to take actions aimed at ensuring a good sleep. Nevertheless, once I force myself to dress quickly and leave home, my body begins to warm up, the blood flow kicks-off, oxygenating every still-dumb part of my body, and my cortisol level increase. It is then when I push these inner processes even further by lifting weights or performing any other mid-intense exercise at the gym. Once I’m back at home, my motivation and ambition has already peaked, and I feel ready to start the day. But you know what? it’s still 8AM!

Another advantage of exercising before work is the feeling of accomplishment. The first daily task is already checked and, due to its impact of general well-being, it’s a must-do one. Therefore, it ensures having a daily dose of motivation, energy and health. Moreover, exercising in the morning also means free time in the afternoon, which enables endless possibilities.

However, it is definitely not all advantages. Sticking to this routine demands consistency and commitment. It is fairly easy to break the routine. Have dinner later than normal, go to sleep too late or, even worse, wake up later than 6AM, and the whole process will tremble.

There seems to be a relationship between optimization, or ideal state, and continuous energy changes zig-zagging between a positive and negative state - the two exclusive and complementary concepts of Yin and Yang, chaos and order, push and pull forces that infinitely seek finding balance at the middle point. Being at the positive state permanently would require infinite energy and, thus, is not feasible. Oscillation feels more natural, and actually needed for a smooth transition between states. Letting it go, temporarily falling in the negative state is necessary for being later impulsed higher in the positive state. That’s why we not only need rest (i.e., sleep) but also favor the up and down stages through our days.

It seems clear to think that the ramp-up moment happens by the time we wake up. Resting serves as the shuttle, ready to boost our energy as soon as we wake up. It is then, when exercise can push this momentum even further up the positive state. Do the most difficult task first, don’t let distractions interfere in your work during the first hours. These frequent advises are built on top of the same concept. The first might be the wider oscillation, or maybe it depends on each person. However, it seems reasonable to think that everyone goes through the same type of oscillations throughout the day. For some, the oscillations may have higher frequency (more ups and downs in a period of 24h). For others, the wider oscillation will happen at the end of the day. Learn how your oscillation looks like, and take an advantage from it. Plan your days according to it.

> The rule of thirds also refers to three-state scenario: a negative (under-performing, pessimist) state, average (nor good nor bad, lagom) state, and positive (over-productive) state.

There could be a system of oscillations. Apart from daily oscillations, we may also need weekly (or monthly) oscillations. 

Is it the direction (gradient) what matters instead of the position in the trajectory? is it both?

Another fact, it is recommended to wake up at the same time, and preferably go to sleep at the same time as well. But c
