Time management is pain management. We always expect to find the definitive tool that will help as be extremely productive and solve our lives. However, we don’t expect to take responsibility on the effort and pain that we have to do for achieving that.

Distraction can be seen as a pulling force that takes us from actually doing tasks that we know we have/need to do, and brings us to a comfort are of easiness and low cognitive effort.

On the contrary, traction represents the pushing force, the commitment, required to get started with a difficult task. Ignoring pulling forces and forcing ourselves to be in a traction mode is painful.

Current tools and approaches mostly try to hide the comfort zones or help you detecting and ignoring pulling forces, but little techniques help you accept that it’s a painful process.
