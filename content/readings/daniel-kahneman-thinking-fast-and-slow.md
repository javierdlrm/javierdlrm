# Quotes

These are, in my opinion, the main insights in the book.

> People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory - and this is largely determined by the extreme of coverage in the media.

> When faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution.

> The social norm against stereotyping, 
 including the opposition to profiling, has been highly beneficial in creating a more civilized and more equal society. It is useful to remember, however, that neglecting valid stereotypes inevitably results in sub-optimal judgments. Resistance to stereotyping is a laudable moral position, but the simplistic idea that the resistance is cost-less is wrong. The costs are worth paying to achieve a better society, but denying that the costs exist, while satisfying to the soul and politically correct, is not scientifically defensible. Reliance on the affect heuristic is common in politically charged arguments. The positions we favor have no costs and those we oppose have no benefits.


> Narratives fallacies arise inevitably from our continuous attempt to make sense of the world. The explanatory stories that people find compelling are simple; are concrete; assign a larger role to talent, stupidity, and intentions than to luck; and focus on a few striking events that happened rather than on the countless events that failed to happen. Any recent salient event is a candidate to become the kernel of a causal narrative.
 
> The idea that the future is unpredictable is undermined every day by the ease with which the past is explained. Our tendency to construct and believe coherent narratives of the past makes it difficult for us to accept the limits of our forecasting ability.
 
> Helbert Simons definition of intuition: The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.
 
> When a project ends reasonably well: once you understand the main conclusion, it seems it was always obvious. 

> It is often the case that when you broaden the frame, you reach more reasonable conclusions. When you see cases in isolation, you are likely to be guided by an emotional reaction of System 1.

> Confusing experience with the memory of it is a compelling cognitive illusion - and it is the substitution that makes us believe a past experience can be ruined.

> Daniel Gilbert Timothy Wilson introduced the word *miswanting* to describe bad choices that arise from errors of affective forecasting. The focusing illusion is a rich source of miswanting. In particular, it makes us prone to exaggerate the effect of significant purchases or changed circumstances on our future wellbeing.


# Concepts

System 1 tries to reach believable answers by ***substituting*** hard questions (target) with easier ones (heuristic).

System 1 can correlate intensities across different dimensions (intensity matching). For example, evilness with colors.

**Affect heuristic,** we tend to favour thoughts aligned to our preferences or likings.

**Associative memory,** to be defined.

**Substitution,** to be defined.

**Inference-matching,** to be defined.

**WYSIATI,** to be defined.

**Halo effect,** to be defined.

**Illusion of skill,** to be defined.

**Illusion of validity,** to be defined.

**Illusion of pundits,** to be defined.

**The Hedgehog and the Fox,** to be defined.

**Prospect theory,** to be defined.

**Reference point,** to be defined.

**Endowment effect,** to be defined.

**Risk-aversion vs Risk-seeking,** to be defined.

**Loss-value function,** to be defined.

**Disposition effect,** to be defined.

**Taboo trade-off,** to be defined.

Framing effect, opt-in vs opt-out form, general revenue, reference point

Two selves, two principles of memory : duration neglect and peak-end rule, 

Focusing illusion, nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.

# Open questions

How system 1 and 2 applies to states of mind (zanshin, fudoshin, mushin,â€¦)?

How could *substitution* and *intensity matching* be applied in machine learning judgement (accurate inference)?
