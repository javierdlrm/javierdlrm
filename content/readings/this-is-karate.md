# Quotes

These are, in my opinion, the main hindsights of this book.

> Keep your head low (modesty), eyes high (ambition), mouth shut (serenity), base yourself on filial piety and benefit others.


> The heart of our karate is real fighting. There can be no proof without real fighting. Without proof there is no trust. Without trust there is no respect. This is a definition in the world of Martial Arts.
 

> Although it is important to study and train for skill in techniques, for the man who wishes to truly accomplish the way of budo, it is important to makehis whole life in training and therefore not aiming for skill and strength alone, but also for spiritual attainment.
 

> A human life gains luster and strength only when it is polished and tempered
 

> One living daily in the Way carries their head low and their eyes high; reserved in speech and possessing a kind heart, they steadfastly continue in their training efforts.
 

> Aspirations must be pure and free of selfishness. Arising from the depths of the soul, aspirations are spiritual demands penetrating all of a human life and making it possible for a person to die for their sake
 

> Always remember that the true meaning of Budo is that soft overcomes hard, small overcomes large.
 

> The most significant life is the one lived on the basis of a personal sense of justice and the desire to see justice realized everywhere.
 

> No matter how strong the rival, the just will always win
 

> Karate is Budo and if Budo is removed from Karate it is nothing more than sport karate, show karate, or even fashion karate-the idea of training merely to be fashionable
 

> Personal greed and egoism are things that cause human beings to forget respect for others and to violate rules that have been established for the sake of peace and friendship
 

> Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.
 

> Water can support a ship and water can also sink a ship.


# Notes

**Filial piety**: In Confucian philosophy, filial piety (zh, "xiào") is a virtue of respect for one's parents, elders, and ancestors.
