My name is Javier de la Rúa Martínez, a first-year PhD student in Scalable Machine Learning (ML) Systems at KTH University in Stockholm, and Software engineer at [Hopsworks](https://www.hopsworks.ai/). My doctoral research centres on the intersection between large-scale distributed systems and machine learning, being my main research interest bridging the gap between offline and online components in ML systems, seeking more automation while keeping humans in the ML loop.

I obtained a double master’s degree in Data Science from KTH University and the Technical University of Madrid (UPM) and bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
