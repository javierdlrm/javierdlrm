My name is Javier de la Rúa Martínez, a doctoral student at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/profile/jdlrm) in Stockholm, and research engineer at [Hopsworks](https://www.hopsworks.ai/). My primary research focus centres at the intersection between large-scale distributed systems and machine learning. My current focus lies on developing and improving data management systems such as Feature Stores to address data challenges in building AI systems.

In addition, I maintain a keen interest in applying Artificial Intelligence and data management techniques in brain science and medical fields such as the study of neurodegenerative diseases.

As for my background, I obtained a double master’s degree in Data Science from KTH Royal Institute of Technology and the Technical University of Madrid (UPM), and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science also from UPM.
