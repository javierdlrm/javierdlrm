My name is Javier de la Rúa Martínez, a doctoral student in Scalable Machine Learning (ML) Systems at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/profile/jdlrm) in Stockholm, and Research engineer at [Hopsworks](https://www.hopsworks.ai/). My research centres on the intersection between large-scale distributed systems and machine learning, being my main research interest bridging the gap between offline and online components in ML systems, seeking greater automation while keeping humans in the ML loop.

I obtained a double master’s degree in Data Science from KTH Royal Institute of Technology and the Technical University of Madrid (UPM), and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science also from UPM.
